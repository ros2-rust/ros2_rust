Introduction
------------

This is a set of projects (bindings, code generator, examples and more) that enables developers to write ROS2
applications in Rust.

Features
--------

The current set of features include:
- Generation of all builtin ROS types
- Support for publishers and subscriptions
- Tunable QoS settings

What's missing?
---------------

Lots of things!
- Component nodes
- Clients and services
- Tests
- Documentation

### Limitations

- The `rclrs` interface is very limited for now and might not be idiomatic yet, any help and suggestion on the interface would be greatly appreciated
- Due to the current ROS2 support of non-default clients, packages containing definitions of messages used in Rust crates must be present in the current workspace; otherwise message crates generation won't be triggered

Sounds great, how can I try this out?
-------------------------------------

Here, the Foxy distribution of ROS 2 is used, but newer distributions can be used by simply replacing 'foxy' with the distribution name.

```
# First, make sure to have ROS 2 and vcstool installed (alternatively, install vcstool with pip):
# sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop ros-foxy-test-interface-files python3-vcstool libclang-dev clang
# Install the colcon-cargo and colcon-ros-cargo plugins
pip install git+https://github.com/colcon/colcon-cargo.git git+https://github.com/colcon/colcon-ros-cargo.git
# Install the cargo-ament-build plugin
cargo install cargo-ament-build

# In your workspace directory (ideally an empty one), run 
mkdir src
git clone https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust.git src/ros2_rust
vcs import src < src/ros2_rust/ros2_rust_foxy.repos
. /opt/ros/foxy/setup.sh
cd /src
colcon build --packages-up-to rclrs_examples
```

It's normal to see a `Some selected packages are already built in one or more underlay workspace` warning. This is because the standard message definitions that are part of ROS 2 need to be regenerated in order to create Rust bindings.

If something goes very wrong and you want to start fresh, make sure to delete all `install*`, `build*` and `.cargo` directories. Also, make sure your terminal does not have any install sourced (check with `echo $AMENT_PREFIX_PATH`, which should be empty).


### Building with `cargo`
As an alternative to `colcon`, Rust packages can be built with pure `cargo`.

However, this will not work out of the box, since the `Cargo.toml` files contain dependencies like `rclrs = "*"`, even though `rclrs` is not published on crates.io. This is intentional and follows ROS 2's principle for packages to reference their dependencies only with their name, and not with their path. At build-time, these dependencies are resolved to a path to the local package by `colcon`, and written into `.cargo/config.toml`. Therefore, the package in question should be built with `colcon` once, and after that `cargo` will be able to use the `.cargo/config.toml` file to find all dependencies.

A second catch is that `cargo` message packages link against native libraries. A convenient way to ensure that they are found is to also source the setup script produced by `colcon`.

As an example, here is how to build `rclcrs_examples` with `cargo`:

```
# Initial build of the package with colcon
# Compare .cargo/config.toml with and without the --lookup-in-workspace flag to see its effect
colcon build --packages-up-to rclrs_examples --lookup-in-workspace
# Source the install directory
. install/setup.sh
cd rclrs_examples
# Run cargo build, or cargo check, cargo doc, etc.
cargo build
```

### Running the publisher and subscriber

Publisher:

```
# Do this in a new terminal
. ./install/setup.sh
ros2 run rclrs_examples rclrs_publisher
```

Subscriber:

```
# Do this in a new terminal
. ./install/setup.sh
ros2 run rclrs_examples rclrs_subscriber
```

Enjoy!
