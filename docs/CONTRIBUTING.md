# Contributing to `ros2_rust`
Contributions to `ros2_rust` are very welcome!

Work is coordinated in via GitHub issues, and there also exists a [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/+rosorg-rust:matrix.org) for general discussion. It's a good idea to check in with the other contributors and seek early-stage feedback when developing a major feature.

There are also occasional ROS 2 Rust WG meetings that are announced on the [ROS discourse forum](https://discourse.ros.org/).


## Coding guidelines
This section is not comprehensive, and conventions from the broader Rust community should be followed.

Use `cargo clippy` to check that code is idiomatic.

### Documentation
For documenting functions, use declarative sentences, not imperative sentences. For instance, `Creates a by-value iterator.` should be used instead of `Create a by-value iterator.`. Use a period at the end of every phrase, even the "brief" description.

Document any panics that might happen in a function, and where it makes sense, also document the errors that may be returned by a function.

When linking to documents from the ROS 2 ecosystem, always use the a link that redirects to the latest version, or a link to the Rolling version.

### Unsafe code
Keep `unsafe` blocks as small as possible.
Annotate every `unsafe` block with a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining why its safety preconditions are met.

### Formatting
Use `cargo fmt` to format code.

Put a `struct`'s definition first, then its trait `impl`s in alphabetical order, then its inherent `impl`s. When there are several `struct`s in one file, one possibility is to put all `struct` definitions at the top of the file, like this:
- `struct A {…}`
- `struct B {…}`
- `impl Bar for A {…}`
- `impl Foo for A {…}`
- `impl A {…}`
- `impl Bar for B {…}`
- `impl Foo for B {…}`
- `impl B {…}`

Try to not exceed a line length of 100 characters for comments.

### Error messages
Error messages should
- be capitalized
- not have punctuation at the end
- not include an "Error:" prefix or similar

### Tests
Prefer using `quickcheck` tests and doctests where they make sense.

Avoid writing tests that simply restate the definition of a function. E.g. for `fn square(x: i32) { x*x }` do not write a test that asserts `square(3) == 3*3`.

### Return type to use when wrapping `rcl` functions
Functions from `rcl` can typically return error codes. This does not necessarily mean that the `rclrs` function using it must return `Result`. If the error conditions can be determined, from reading `rcl` comments and source code, to never occur, the return code doesn't need to be propagated but only `debug_assert!`ed to be ok. This assert guards against `rcl` introducing a new error condition in the future.

An example would be a function that only returns an error when the pointer we pass in is null or points to an uninitialized object. If we obtain the pointer from a reference, it can't be null, and if the object that is referenced is guaranteed to be initialized, there is no need to return a `Result`.

### References vs raw pointers

Do not cast references to raw pointers where it's not needed. Since references coerce to raw pointers, they can be directly used as arguments to C functions in most cases.

### Implementing the `Drop` trait

Generally, a `rcl` type should have a `Drop` impl that calls its `fini()` function. However, there are some cases where this is not possible, e.g. when the type is part of another `rcl` type that owns and finalizes it, or when the `fini()` function takes extra arguments. In these cases, it needs to be decided individually if and where to call `fini()`, and care must be taken to not return early from a function with `?` before the relevant `fini()` functions have been called.
